      'As the Dev Lead for a 9-person team in The Opportunity Project 2023, I directed the development of a full-stack application for the Community Test Lab. This platform facilitates efficient Covid-19 test result reporting and provides a user-friendly data dashboard displaying key statistics. Implementing unit tests using Jest ensured the reliability of our Postgres Sequelize back-end, seamlessly integrated into our CI pipeline via Github Actions. Our React-native front-end, built with TypeScript and styled using Nativewindcss, promises a polished user experience. Deployment to AWS RDS and Elastic Beanstalk optimized performance, while our front-end awaits review for App Store and Google Play inclusion, reflecting our commitment to quality and innovation.',

My colleague and I applied tailwindcss styling to enhance the user interface and incorporated a touch-enabled slideshow to improve user experience. We deployed the application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and attached it to a custom domain that the customer had previously purchased. We followed a professional and technical approach to ensure the application met the client's requirements and adhered to industry best practices. Our aim was to deliver a high-quality web application that met the client's needs and exceeded their expectations.`,
